### Note:

​	The map is 9000*160, Each point occupies 10 pixel points

​	So each point is moving on a grid 450 squares long and 4 squares wide (having removed the borders on both sides)

​	So we can think of each grid as one meter and every iteration is 1s . And so the people will walk on a street that is 450 meters long and 4 meters wide. The movement speed of all people is 1m/s, while the movement speed of "special" is 1~2m/s.

* ### Runing this program

  ​	run *view.py* program

  

* ### In *resource*  file

  *map.txt* is the "2d array_map", *white2.png* is the background

  

* ### About the simulation animation

  #### first figure: Crowdsimulation

  *rea_point* means the people have been infected

  *green_point* means the people have not been infected

  *blue_point* means the special persons (can count how many people he meet)

  #### Second figure: Number of people get covid Vs. Number of people not get covid

  *red line* means the people have been infected

  *green line* means the people have not been infected

  #### Third figure: Take the point "special" as the center, and how many people are in this range
